### 문제 설명

<p>The latest Table-Top Role Playing Game is out now: <em>Better Dice</em>. Unlike all other TTRPGs, this one is all about dice. In fact, it is all about the <em>better die</em>: decisions are made, friendships gained and lost, fights fought, battles won, all based on who has the <em>better die</em>.</p>

<p>This game uses special $n$-sided dice where each of the $n$ faces has the same probability of being rolled. Moreover, each die has its own special set of $n$ numbers on the faces.</p>

<p>While playing <em>Better Dice</em> you ended up in a very precarious situation where you must absolutely have a <em>better die</em> than your opponent, that is, you must roll higher than your opponent. Given both your die and your opponent's die, decide who is more likely to roll a higher number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line with an integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 1000$), the number of sides on each die.</li>
	<li>Two lines, each with $n$ integers $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 10^9$), the values on one of the dice.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output "<code>first</code>" if the first die is more likely to roll a higher number than the second die. Output "<code>second</code>" if the second die is more likely to roll a higher number than the first die. Output "<code>tie</code>" if they are both equally likely to come up higher than the other.</p>
