### 문제 설명

<p>A worm is at the bottom of a pole. It wants to reach the top, but it is too lazy to climb to the top without stopping. It can crawl up the pole a certain number of inches at a time, falling down a lesser number of inches right after while it rests. How many times does the worm need to crawl up in order to reach the top of the pole?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line that contains three integers $a, b$ ($0 \leq b < a \leq 100$), and $h$, ($0 < h \leq 100\,000$) indicating the amount $a$ of inches the worm can climb at a time, the amount $b$ of inches the worm falls during its resting period, and the height $h$ of the pole, respectively.  Note: For the purposes of this problem, the worm is modeled as a point and thus has no length.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the number of times the worm must crawl up in order to reach the top of the pole. </p>
